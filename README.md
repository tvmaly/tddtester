# tddtester

this is a commandline application that simplifys the process of automatically running your tests as part of the 
test driven development cycle.  

I wrote more about the step of doing this with different utilities in my blog post
[How to do Test Driven Development with Go on OSX](http://tysonmaly.com/programming/go/test-driven-developement-with-golang-on-osx/)

## Status
this application is in progress
